## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

These initial challenges were good for reviewing old information

Like how to start an HTML from scratch wihtout using ! on Visual Studio Code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```
Lots of qualifty of life tricks.
Like clicking with alt to select multiple lines at once. That way i can type in several lines, instead of having to copy paste a bunch of times

Also some good practices as reusable classes, instead of one time specific solutions:
```css
/* .sidebar p {
    font-size: 12px;
} */
.source {
    font-size: 10px;
}
```

### Continued development

The course seems like the perfect review, and is bount to lead to amazing projects for my future portfolio

### Useful resources

- [For box-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - This helped me with just getting a quick reference of how to write box-shadow
